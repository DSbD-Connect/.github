# DsbD-Connect
These repositories contain code and instructions from the technology demonstrators created by the [Oxford e-Research Centre](https://oerc.ox.ac.uk/) (OeRC) (Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford) as part of Innovate UK's [Digital Security by Design](https://www.dsbd.tech/) project, in partnership with [CyberHive](https://www.cyberhive.com/).

**Principal Investigator**: David Wallom

**Researchers**: Martin Higgins, Reuben Green, Tolga YÄ±lmaz

This research was funded by [UK Research and Innovation](https://www.ukri.org/) (UKRI) under project number 10017394.

## Project Overview
The DSbD project aims to promote the concept of building digital security into the design of our technology, rather than regarding it as an extra "add-on" layer. A key
technology in DSbD's approach is [Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions (CHERI)](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/), an enhancement to
existing processor architectures which adds hardware-level protection against memory-access bugs, together with tools for building innovative new memory-protection structures.
Our project pairs the secure platform offered by a CHERI processor with [CyberHive Connect](https://www.cyberhive.com/product/cyberhive-connect/), a mesh VPN which offers
post-quantum encryption.

Our demonstrators explore the possible application of the combination of CHERI and CyberHive Connect accross a range of different sectors.

## Demonstrators

### ev_demonstrator
Our Electric Vehicle Charging Demonstrator is part of a work package to showcase CHERI and Connect in the context of an electric vehicle charging station.

### CHERI-central-control-server
A demonstration of the use of CHERI and CyberHive Connect for secure networking.
